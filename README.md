Known Issues and Testing
Issues
Game Freeze on CandySwamp: When the player reaches the CandySwamp and presses 'F', the game freezes while audio continues. Investigations suggest this might be related to the game loop or event handling within Play.js.

Collision Handling: Some collision detections are not consistent, especially at higher speeds, potentially due to timing issues in the update loop.

Testing
Checkpoint and Obstacle Mechanics: Frequent testing is required to ensure that the spawning and behavior of checkpoints and obstacles are consistent and bug-free.

Player Interactions: Thorough testing of player controls and interactions with game objects is critical, particularly after implementing new features or adjustments.

Performance Testing: Regular performance tests are recommended to identify any potential lag or rendering issues, especially on different devices.
